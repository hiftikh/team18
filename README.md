# Welcome to Team 18's FitByte App

## Working with our repository

Clone our repository onto your local system:

```
git clone ssh://git@repo.gaul.csd.uwo.ca:7999/cs2212_w2016/team18.git
```

Then: 

```
mvn package
```

If you want to run the jar in test mode put in:

```
java -jar target/team18-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar test
```

If you don't want to run in test mode

```
java -jar target/team18-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```

Our UI was developed and is optimized to run on Mac OS.
It will run on Windows; however, the UI will not look the same 
as there will be graphical issues.
